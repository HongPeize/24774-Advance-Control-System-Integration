# 24774-Advance-Control-System-Integration
This course focuses on the practical implementation of feedback/feedforward controllers. The 
entire  controller  design  process  is  presented,  including  system  modeling  and  identification, 
compensator design, simulation, and hardware prototyping. This is a project-based course in 
which students complete the controller design process on a nonlinear, MIMO hardware system. 
The goal is train students on the system integration skills necessary for success in industry or 
experimental laboratory work.
